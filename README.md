# Good_Morning Chrome Extension  

## Goal:
Chrome Extension that shows current weather as well as forecasts for my Home, Work and Charity. 
The info should display as a pop-up window when the Extension Icon is clicked.  

## Weather:
+ Currently, I am using darksky API for the weather information.  
+ the weather data is updated once per hour (no matter how often the icon is clicked)
+ the user sees time of data, temperature, summary of daily weather change and a table with weather forecasts every 2 hours for the next 24 hours 

## Layout:
+ using Google Fonts
+ www.subtlepatterns.com variation for background
+ updated table design
