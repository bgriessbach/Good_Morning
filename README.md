# Good_Morning Chrome Extension  

## Goal:
Chrome Extension that shows current weather as well as forecasts and train times for my Home, Work and Charity. 
The info should display as a pop-up window when the Extension Icon is clicked.  

## Weather:
Currently, I am using darksky API for the weather information.  
### Current Challenges:
+ ~~Data is not updating dynamically in the popup on refresh~~ (data updates once per hour)
+ ~~converting time from unix timestamp~~ (Done!)
+ ~~make day forecast cleaner and easier to understand (table with times, rain possibility and temperature?)~~ (Done!)
+ made functions and variable names more concise

## Trains:
Currently not implemented yet. I want to show the times of the next leaving trains/busses from current location to stored locations. 

## Layout:
+ using Google Fonts
+ www.subtlepatterns.com variation for background
+ working on a green color scheme
+  updated table design
